  Introduction
  ============
  The project BuilderDemo is an implementation of:
   - 'Creational' Design Pattern Builder,
  Design Patterns are the basic building blocks for creating maintainable software.

  Designing object-oriented software is hard, and designing reusable object-oriented software is even harder.
  Experienced object-oriented designers will tell you that a reusable and flexible design is difficult
  if not impossible to get "right" the first time.
  Before a design is finished, they usually try to reuse it several times, modifying it each time.

  The given implementation is made with the following purpose:
   1. Complete working example of the pattern written in Java.
   2. Complete building by the client with ANT and JAVA.
   3. No External Libraries needed.
   4. The code-example is made to explain the pattern in Java and not to explain Java.

   How to use
   ==========
   The following actions are required:
   - Extract Archive-file into a directory of your choice.
   - Open a terminal window (UNIX) or a DOS Command window (Windows).
   - Goto the directory containing the files 'build.xml' and 'build.info'
   - Execute the command 'ant all' to run almost all available commands.

   Requirements
   ============
    JAVA Developer
      Download JAVA from the website http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
      Follow th instruction given on the JAVA website.
    Apache ANT
      Download ANT from the website http://ant.apache.org
      Follow the instruction given on the APche ANT website.
    ANT-Script Base Directory
      The ANT-build script has a default 'base' directory, which is the (partly relative) default directory.
      All other directories are derived from this location.
      Normally you should not change this.
      Do not make changes unless you are familiar with ANT and know what you are doing.
